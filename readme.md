You will learn the essential basics of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance will allow you to write code that can perform the same process but for different objects. Polymorphism helps to initiate different processes for different objects by using the same method. Youâ€™ll also learn to prevent other users of your code to modify the variables using encapsulation.
